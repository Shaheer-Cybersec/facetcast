"""
base agent - the contract every Facetcast agent follows.

An agent declares:
  agent_id  tracking tag, e.g. "A01"
  name      stage name, e.g. "ingest"
  requires  context keys it needs before it can run
  produces  the ONE context key it writes its output into
  uses_llm  True for the LLM agents, False for the static (pure code) ones

An agent implements run(ctx) -> dict.
The orchestrator only ever calls execute(ctx), which:
  - checks inputs exist
  - times the run
  - catches every error and returns a StageRecord (never crashes the pipeline)
  - rejects output that is not JSON-serializable
